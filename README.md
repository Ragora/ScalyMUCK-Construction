# ScalyMUCK-Construction

This is the source code for the Construction modification for use with [ScalyMUCK](https://github.com/Ragora/ScalyMUCK).
It aimed to provide a more user-friendly world modification tool in comparison to those that existed in FuzzBall and
TinyMUCK servers that required memorization of obscure and archaic commands along with their even more obscure syntax.
